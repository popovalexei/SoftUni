# SoftUni

Since October 2022 I am dedicated to improving my skills at Software University (SoftUni), Bulgaria, following the Software Engineering path and becoming a certified JS Web Developer. 

In this repository I am going to add all the coding exercises I have done during the practice courses.

If you need any help/explanation/ or additional information - do not hesitate to contact me.
Enjoy!
